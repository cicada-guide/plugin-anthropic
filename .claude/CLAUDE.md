# cicada-guide plugin

A Claude Code **plugin**, not an application. Every file here is Markdown or JSON read by a
plugin loader: there is no build step, no dependencies, and nothing to compile. The
MCP server the plugin points at is a separate, private repo (`cicada-guide/mcp-anthropic`) — its
source is not in this tree; change it in that repo, then update the tool docs here after it deploys.

This file covers working *on* the repo. User-facing behavior is [README.md](../README.md); release
process and already-settled decisions are [PUBLISHING.md](../PUBLISHING.md). Neither is duplicated
here — prefer fixing those files over growing this one.

## Verifying a change

Run the offline checks before every commit. They need only Node 22, no install and no network:

```bash
node scripts/check.mjs
```

They cover the invariants below: the three version fields, manifest names and `source`, the pinned
endpoint and server key, skill and agent frontmatter, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and Markdown links,
tool counts in prose, the numbers in each restated dataset rule, each entry point carrying the
rules it relies on, phrases that critique the dataset, and any mention of a bill synopsis, which
the server never returns. The project docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/`) get the link, tool-count, number and critique checks too.
`.github/workflows/check.yml` runs them on every pull request, then Claude Code's own
`claude plugin validate --strict` on both manifests, `skills` and `agents`. When a rule changes on
purpose, change `scripts/check.mjs` in the same commit.

`node scripts/check-live-tools.mjs` reconciles the tool documentation against the live
`tools/list`: every live tool documented in the three tool lists, no documented tool the server
lacks, no example or parameter table passing a parameter the schema does not declare, every
documented card URI one a live tool links, and, on a live run, every card resource and the version
before it still reading. `.github/workflows/live-tools.yml` runs it nightly and on demand, never on a pull request, so a
server outage cannot block a merge. `--file tools-list.json` checks a saved response instead.

Neither script can tell whether Claude follows the guidance. For that, load the checkout into a
real session:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin
```

`/mcp` should list `guide-public` as connected, and `/help` should show the plugin's slash
commands. `curl https://public.cicada.guide/health` reports server health.

After changing a skill or agent, also run the eval suite in `evals/` with `claude plugin eval`,
passing `--judge-model sonnet`: the small default judge has failed correct answers. The command
and what each case measures are in
[How to verify a change](../docs/howto-verify-a-change.md#5-run-the-eval-suite).

The server is public and needs no account, so **anyone can run that check from a fork** — there is
no privileged setup. What an outside contributor cannot verify is anything about the server's
deployment or its private repo; treat the endpoint as a fixed external dependency.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Claude manifest |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Marketplace entry, `"source": "./"` — the repo root *is* the plugin |
| `.mcp.json` | The single declaration of the MCP endpoint |
| `skills/get-legislation/` | Always-on skill, plus `references/` (tool reference, workflows, project settings) |
| `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Other skills are slash commands, one directory each |
| `agents/` | Subagents, one Markdown file each |
| `cicada-guide.local.md.example` | Template users copy to `.claude/cicada-guide.local.md` |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` | Human-facing project docs. CONTRIBUTING points here rather than restating the rules |
| `docs/` | `README.md` index, `architecture.md`, `troubleshooting.md` — human-facing, never loaded into a session |
| `docs/solutions/` | Documented solutions to past problems, organized by category with YAML frontmatter (`module`, `tags`, `problem_type`). Relevant when implementing or debugging in documented areas |
| `scripts/` | `check.mjs` (offline invariants) and `check-live-tools.mjs` (docs against the live server) |
| `.github/workflows/` | `check.yml` on every pull request; `live-tools.yml` nightly; `tag-release.yml` tags each version bump on `main` |

## Invariants

These break installed users silently — no error, sometimes no symptom until someone reports a
wrong answer. `scripts/check.mjs` catches the mechanical ones; the rest need a reviewer.

**Version is three fields in two files.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and *both*
`metadata.version` and `plugins[0].version` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. They
are independent fields that drift when one is missed. Grep before committing a bump:
`grep -rn '"version"' .claude-plugin`.

**Cross-component links use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, never relative paths.** A subagent's working
directory is the user's project, so `../skills/...` resolves to nothing. Within
`skills/get-legislation/`, sibling `references/*.md` may be referenced relatively.

**The MCP `<server>` path segment is mandatory.** Tools reach the model as
`mcp__plugin_cicada-guide_guide-public__<tool>`. Dropping `guide-public` produces a name no
configuration can reach.

**The endpoint hostname is a published API surface.** It appears in `.mcp.json` and in prose.
Changing it breaks every installed user with no warning and no fallback; it moves only with a
version bump and a transition period where the old hostname still resolves. The path follows the
same rule: 0.9.0 moved it from `/mcp` to `/mcp-anthropic`, and the server still answers `/mcp` for
copies installed before.

**Tool documentation drifts silently.** The endpoint is unversioned, so nothing signals when the
live server gains, renames, or drops a tool. Tool lists are duplicated in `README.md`,
`skills/get-legislation/SKILL.md`, and `references/tool-reference.md`. Before editing any of
them, run `tools/list` against the live endpoint (the server is stateless, so it is one POST; the
command is in PUBLISHING.md) and reconcile all three against the server — not against each other.
Avoid writing a tool *count* into prose; it is the first thing to go stale.

**Never document a tool or parameter that you have not seen the server return.** Input schemas
reject unknown keys outright rather than ignoring them, so a plausible invented name is not a
harmless doc error — it is a runtime failure for every user who follows it.

**Dataset rules are restated in every entry point, not referenced.** Subagents never load the
`get-legislation` skill, and a slash command can run without it, so each skill and agent carries
its own copy of whichever of these rules it relies on: `search_bills`' exact bill-number matching
and query caps, `get_rollcalls` including vote-linked roll calls, never adding counts across roll
calls, the 100-id `search_people` batch cap, the two error shapes, the 60-a-minute rate limit,
25,000-character truncation, keeping credentials, personal data and names out of `context`,
passing back the `conversation_id` an earlier result returned and never making one up, treating
`governor_action` as the state's general rule and never computing a date from it, and loading a
tool listed by name only before calling it. Agents also state that `Read` is for
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` files only. When one changes, grep `skills/` and `agents/` for its other
copies and update every one. A lagging copy gives only that entry point the wrong answer, so
nothing else looks broken.

## Product constraints

Deliberate limits, not oversights. Restating them is much of what the skills do, so relaxing one
means editing many files — do it as an explicit decision, never as a side effect.

- **U.S. state legislatures only.** No federal bills, municipal ordinances, or ballot measures.
- **Read-only.** Nothing here contacts officials, files documents, or changes state.
- **Legislators are never graded, scored, ranked, or predicted**, and claims come only from what a
  tool actually returned.
- **No account, API key, or OAuth.** Anonymous access is a feature; keep it that way.
- **The `context` analytics string carries no credentials, personal data, or names**, and
  `llm_model` carries only a model identifier or `"unknown"`.
- **Nothing here critiques the dataset's quality.** The repo is public. Describe what the tools
  return and how to use it, not what is wrong with the data.

## Conventions

- Prose wraps at ~100 columns. Frontmatter `description:` values stay on one line; tables unwrapped.
- Skill and agent prose is addressed to Claude at runtime: imperative and specific ("Pass at least
  one of `rollcall_id`, `bill_id`, or `people_id`"), not explanatory.
- Match the surrounding files for tone and heading style rather than introducing a new one.
- Commit subjects are plain sentence case with no prefix or tag.
- Nothing in this repo is secret, but nothing user-specific belongs in it either: per-project
  settings live in `.claude/*.local.md`, which is gitignored.

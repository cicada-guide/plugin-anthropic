# Why the plugin is card-first

This page is for contributors changing how the skills and agents use the server's interactive
cards. It explains why an answer ends with a card, why the card is never the source of a written
claim, and why subagents name a card instead of showing one. For what each card shows and
returns, see the [cards reference](reference-cards.md) and the
[tool reference](../skills/get-legislation/references/tool-reference.md#cards).

## The problem

The server renders four tools as MCP Apps cards: `search_bills` (a results list), `show_bill`,
`show_official`, and `show_person_record`. In a host that supports MCP Apps, a card is the best
view of the data it covers. A bill card has tabs for an overview, sponsors, documents with a
viewer, and floor votes with party splits. A legislator's contact card has a photo, a button for every
kind of recorded contact option, and a district map. A written answer can't match that, and trying to
re-create it in prose buries the reader in rows they can already see.

The cards raise three problems for guidance, though:

- **Not every host renders them.** A terminal, or any host without MCP Apps, gets only what the
  tool call returns. The answer has to work there too.
- **The card shows more than the model sees.** A card fetches its own data over the host bridge
  after it opens. That data never passes through the model.
- **A card only renders in the conversation the user is looking at.** A subagent's tool calls
  are not shown to the user.

## Card-first, not card-only

Since 0.8.0 each workflow ends with the card that fits, without asking the user first:

| Answer | Card |
| --- | --- |
| A bill brief, or a roll-call breakdown on one bill | `show_bill` with the bill's `id` and an assistant-written `headline` and `summary` |
| Who a legislator is, or how to reach them | `show_official` |
| A resolved legislator's voting record | `show_person_record` |
| Any bill search | `search_bills` renders its own results card on every call |

The card comes last, after the written answer is ready. Showing it without asking saves a round
trip spent asking permission, and a host that can't render cards gets the call's text back
instead, so the call is always safe.

The written answer changes shape when a card is on screen. It doesn't re-list rows, tallies, or
contact buttons the card already shows. It gives what the card doesn't: the answer to the
question, the context, and the caveats. It still stands on its own, because the guidance can't
know whether the host rendered anything.

## What reaches the model

A card tool returns two things, and the host decides which one the model receives:

- **The text fallback.** A short Markdown body. For `show_bill` it holds the bill number, state
  and session, title, status, subjects, the newest document's link, the document count, and the `id`. For `show_official` it holds the seat line,
  the term when recorded, party, and one email, phone and website each.
- **`structuredContent`.** The typed JSON the card renders from. For `show_bill` it is the bill
  row plus `_display`, which echoes the `headline` and `summary` passed. For `show_official` it
  carries every recorded contact option in `contact_options`, where the text has only one of each.

Neither carries what the card fetches for itself. The bill card calls `get_bill_dossier` and
`get_rollcall_breakdown` for its sponsors and votes; the legislator record calls
`get_person_votes` for its vote history. None of those results reach the model through the card.
`show_person_record` returns the person and their seat, never their votes. `show_bill`'s text
fallback leaves out the `headline` and `summary` it was given; its `structuredContent` echoes them
as `_display.aiHeadline` and `_display.aiSummary`, which are Claude's own words, not evidence.

So every written claim comes from the data tools: `get_bill_dossier`, `get_rollcalls`,
`get_rollcall_breakdown`, `get_person_votes`, and `get_latest_bill_document`. The card is the
view; the data tools are the evidence. That split also keeps the answer honest in a text-only host,
where the card never existed.

The server takes the same approach from its side. Each card is a static HTML resource that
receives its data from the tool result and never interpolates it into markup, so every tool has a
text representation and a card representation. The server repository's UI explanation covers that
design; this repo only decides when to show a card and what to write beside it.

## Why subagents name a card instead of calling it

A subagent's output goes back to the conversation that dispatched it, not to the user. A card it
opened would render nowhere, and would spend a rate-limited call on nothing. So each agent ends its
report with the card that fits its result, and the main conversation makes the call:

- `bill-brief-researcher` ends with `show_bill {id, headline, summary}` and a `headline` and
  `summary` the caller must pass, written under the same rules as the skills' own; when the text
  could not be read, the summary says so.
- `legislator-disambiguator` names `show_official` or `show_person_record`, and only for a
  `RESOLVED` verdict. An ambiguous result names no card, because showing one would present a
  guess as an identification.

`legislator-disambiguator` does call `show_official`, but only to read a candidate's recorded
seat, never to display it. That is the one exception, and the agent's prose says so.

## The assistant summary

`show_bill` requires a `summary`: plain prose for a voter, 1 to 1,500 characters, saying what the
bill does, who it affects, and where it stands as recorded. The card puts it in a summary box, so
a bill card never appears without one.

Three rules shape it, each for a reason:

- **It is labelled as AI-written.** The card shows it under "Summary · your AI assistant". A
  reader can't tell a summary's source from its position on a card, so the label keeps the assistant's words
  separate from the legislature's.
- **It never infers passage or an outcome.** Passage thresholds vary by chamber and question, and
  a status such as `Passed` can record one chamber or a committee. The summary states the recorded
  `status` and stops there. A prediction on a card that looks official would read as a fact.
- **It comes from text the model read.** The model reads the bill before calling, and bases the
  summary on `get_latest_bill_document` text. When the text could not be read, the summary says so
  rather than guess.

The server trims the value and rejects an empty one; Markdown doesn't render, because the card
shows it as text.

`show_bill` also requires a `headline`: one plain-text line for a voter, 1 to 120 characters,
saying what the bill does, such as "Bans buying soda and candy with SNAP benefits". The card's title
plate shows it first, and tapping the plate toggles to the official title and back. Official
titles are written for the statute book, so a short line in plain language comes first and the
legislature's wording is one tap away. The headline follows the same rules as the summary: it
comes from text the model read, and it never claims passage or an outcome.

No card opens a bill by itself. Tapping a bill in the `search_bills` results card or in the
legislator record posts an ordinary user turn, `Show HB 314 (bill id <uuid>) with show_bill. …`,
asking the model to read the bill and call `show_bill` with a headline and a summary. Routing the
tap through the conversation is what keeps both required: only the model can write them. The skills
handle that turn as a small workflow of its own: read the text, then call `show_bill`
with the headline and summary, with a short chat answer optional.

## Model-context updates carry names, not ids

When the user selects something on a card, such as a floor vote, a document, or a vote filter,
the card tells the host, and the host passes the model a short text update such as
`User is viewing HB 314 votes. Selected floor vote: <description>, <date>.` It is context, not a
new turn.

These updates carry the names and numbers the user sees, never ids. The guidance therefore maps
them back to ids from earlier results in the conversation. A question such as "which vote am I
looking at" is answered from the update alone, with no tool call. For that vote's details, the
model finds the roll call with `get_rollcalls` on the bill, matching the description and date,
and passes its `id` to `get_rollcall_breakdown`.

## Legislator cards and the no-grading rule

The legislator record shows a tally of the recorded votes it has loaded; the contact card shows none.
The tally labels what it covers, and the guidance never uses one to grade, score, or rank a legislator. A
tally over a handful of votes is a view of those votes, nothing more. See
[why legislators are never graded](explanation-dataset-rules.md#why-legislators-are-never-graded).

Contact details are absent for most officials. When the card has none, the answer says so and
never supplies an address, phone, or email from a pattern or from elsewhere.

## How this changed in 0.8.0

Before 0.8.0 the display tools were used on request: "show me" or "pull it up" led to `show_bill`,
and exploration went to `open_research_desk`, a separate search workspace. The server has since
stopped serving that workspace, and 0.8.0 removed it from the README, the skills, the tool
reference, and the project-settings template. Its job moved to the `search_bills` results card,
which pages itself with "Show more" and, in 0.8.0, opened a bill in place when the user tapped it.

The same release made the workflows card-first, added the `show_bill` summary and the handling
for the card's summary request, and added the model-context update guidance. It also made subagents
name the card that fits their result.

After 0.8.0 the server made `summary` required and stopped opening bills inside the results card
and the legislator record. A tapped bill now posts a request to show it with `show_bill`, and the
bill card's own summary button went away with the optional summary. The server then added a
required `headline`, which the card's title plate shows before the official title. The full list
is in the
[changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Trade-offs

- **Two representations to keep in step.** Every card workflow writes an answer from the data
  tools and shows a card that fetches the same data independently. A change to what a card shows
  can change what the answer should leave out, so the guidance and the tool reference both need
  review when a card changes.
- **Extra calls.** Grounding a bill answer in `get_bill_dossier` and `get_rollcalls` and then
  showing the card costs more calls than showing the card alone, against the rate limit. The
  plugin accepts that cost so that every written claim has a source the model actually read.
- **The host decides.** Which of the text fallback and `structuredContent` reaches the model
  differs by host, so the guidance describes both and relies on neither for anything beyond
  identity, seat, and contact details.
